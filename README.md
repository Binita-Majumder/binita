Binita Majumder – Analytics & Data Projects

Hello, I am Binita Majumder

I have an academic background in Tourism and Hospitality Management, supported by a Bachelor’s degree in Accounting. Over time, I’ve developed a strong interest in data-driven work, especially through my role as an Operations Executive at Shenzhen Shangyu Co., Ltd. My experience in operations, reporting, and process coordination has strengthened my analytical mindset and my ability to work with operational data with accuracy and clarity. 

During my studies, I built a solid foundation in business processes. Through advanced Excel training and hands-on work, I gained skills in data entry, VLOOKUP, IF formulas, SUMIFS, and conditional formatting. I also completed training in Tally Prime, which improved my understanding of basic accounting, voucher entry, inventory management, and financial reporting. 

Recently, I expanded my data skills further by completing a 3-day data analytics masterclass, where I learned the basics of Power BI and Tableau, including data cleaning and building simple dashboards. These experiences have deepened my interest in using data to understand trends, support decisions, and solve operational challenges. 

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tools and improving my skills in analytics and reporting.
